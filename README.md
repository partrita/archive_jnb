# Jupyter notebooks

This is my backup for my ipynb files.

Notebook documents are documents produced by the Jupyter Notebook App, which contain both computer code and rich text elements. Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis.
